Archosaurs,Many of the things we would think of as dinosaurs do not actually fit that biological classification -- the Archosaurs are a family containing all dinosaurs* but also creatures like Pteranodons and Crocodiles. An incredibly interesting area of study!,Archosaurs.jpg
Birds,We all know birds are descended from dinosaurs* keeping their best qualities thriving well into the Holocene* so why not come appreciate the ferocity of a runaway turkey.,Birds.webp
Ornithopods,Perhaps the least iconic of the Dino classifications* Ornithopods are nonetheless incredibly interesting. From duck-billed Hadrosaurs to tank-like Ankylosaurs* and the iconic Triceratops to the lesser-known Dryosaurus* Ornithopoda has everything you could want all in one place!,Ornithopods.jpg
Reptiles,Whilst some prehistoric non-dinosaurs can be classed as Archosaurs* some (like Mosasaurus or Plesiosaurs) are just mostly-unrelated reptiles from a similar age. So here's your place to talk about the wonderful world of prehistoric reptiles!,Mosasaurus.webp
Sauropods,Taller than the trees* the real titans of prehistory. Diplodocus* Brachiosaurus* Brontosaurus* Argentinasaurus -- there's countless examples of creatures too big to imagine.,sauropoddino.jpg
Theropods,The family of icons like T-Rex and Velociraptor* and the only surviving dinosaur family through birds* theropods is the family of variety. Agile* warm-blooded sprinters* massive bruisers* and tiny gliders all count themselves as part of this proud lineage.,Jurassic_Park_Tyrannosaurus_Rex.webp
